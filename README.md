Check your fridge now! According to studies, there are average 5 food products rotting away in the fridge now!

Food waste is a huge problem in first-world countries and it results in an enormous carbon footprint. 
When I say Enormous, it counts to 8 percent of total human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. 
Americans throw away 103 pounds of spoiled food from their fridge every year and it adds up to 6,180 pounds over the average adult lifetime.


Our solution, FridgeKit is a camera that can be mounted on any general refrigerator. 
Its purpose is to capture grocery product that are being placed in the fridge and classify objects with estimated expired date. 
It contains a magnetic bar that can stick to the fridge door and a built-in clicker that can cap into the levels inside a fridge.

It can provide daily notification of the updated grocery status on the user’s phone to prevent food spoil.
Reduce food waste and therefore reduce monthly costs in groceries.
The cheap and practical alternative of buying an all-in-one high price smart fridge and therefore reducing the number of disposals of used refrigerators.
And it contains easy and fast software update.


Now we will show a demo from the point of view of the FridgeKit Camera interacting with a User.
As you can see, our camera will detect the yogurt that is put into the fridge. And it expires in 10 days! 
When user puts in a new product, our camera will automatically detect the object and sent the data into our application without any burdon. 
We all know loading products into the fridge can be a hassle task and we might not have the free hands to take photos in the meantime. 


When user finished loading groceries into the fridge, they can use our application to edit any mislabeling products. 
Our app will provide daily notification of the updated grocery status to prevent food spoil and thus save money for our user.
As the user continues to use our app, our app will understands more in how to correctly label grocery products and reduce error rates along the way with Machine Learning enhancement.
Combine with the power of our FridgeKit Camera we provide a Easy to Use smart fridge upgrade. 
This is a lower cost and more practical alternative of buying an all-in-one high price smart fridge and therefore reducing the number of used fridge disposals.
We help the earth by reducing food waste and also prevent chemical leaks from disposals of used refrigerators.


For tech stack, our Camera hardware is going to interact with our NodeJS server that utilize OpenCV for image detection. 
The NodeJS server will host on AWS ec2 and interact with mobile React Native App for notification. Our Sql Database will be hosted on AWS RDS.
For hardware, we need to build a camera that is capable of wireless connection and bluetooth transmission
From user’s perspective they will be mainly interacting with our mobile application and the FridgeKit Camera.


Our project includes 2 hardware engineers, 2 software developers, and one marketing specialist.
The expected cost for the project is around one million, and that includes half-million development cost and half-million marketing cost. 
Our expected retail price for the final commercial product is around $200 dollars. 
To break even in the business, we need to sell 5000 units to cover the investment cost.
However, we estimate that the product can save up to $500 dollars per household annually based on our market research.
In 2021, about 10.5 million families were living in Canada. 
If we assume that 0.5% of the canadian families, that is 50 thousands families, can purchase our product. 
The total saving from our FridgeKit can reduce 1,200 tons of food waste and save $25 million for our clients.
If we get the investment, we will have the final commercial product within a year. 


On the market, the average smart fridge is expensive, which it tends to range in cost from around $2,000 to $5,000.
Another product, smarter FridgeCam, focuses on encouraging people to buy more groceries in case the food runs out. 
At last, our product is the only kind in the market right now that focuses in saving rather than spending even more.


Please, go check out your fridge after all the presentations.  Thank you.
